pain and suffering

## Here is my chuuni book from back then if you remember
```
Opportunity was started from a discussion in RD Discord about colonization.

And I decided to actually start a colony, and with the help of everyone, we are here today in this rapidly growing town.

Even though the town has existed for less than two months, we have flourished and gain the status of a major town among the original towns.

Despite all the troubles we faced since the first days, we still developed the town with dedication from every citizens.

I want to thank all of you for joining me in building this town together, and created a friendly community for all.

No matter if I quit the server or not, I will still observe the growth of this town, and wish for it to stay as a friendly community, the Town of Opportunity.

We do not know when the server reset is, and if we will last until then.

But as a part of Opportunity or not, I wish for you to have a great time in TGN and in life.

See you all later.
