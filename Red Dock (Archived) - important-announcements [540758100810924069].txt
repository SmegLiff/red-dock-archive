@everyone nba posted thisThe Minecraft server (on 1.13.2 Java edition IP: osmc.teengamingnights.net) will undergo host migration to a complete new host to keep up with the growing demand of resources on Thursday, February 14 at 12:00 PM PST (-8 GMT). This will result in a beefy downtime period of 6 hours to allow room for extensive testing, files, and database transfers. 
We expect to be back online at 6:00 PM PST (-8 GMT).
Thanks for your continued support and patience during this downtime!

[13-Feb-19 04:43 AM] danvivos#3447
recipe for carbonara: 
My process is always as follows
Fry chopped bacon until crispy and all grease is released.
Sweat minced garlic in bacon grease until fragrant
Add cooked pasta, don"t dump pasta water, stir until coated with grease
Remove from heat, add cheese, mix until cheese coats pasta
Add mixed whole eggs, stir constantly until sauce forms and is consistent *EDIT: Add pasta water 2 Tbsp at a time to thicken sauce if necessary.
Adding the cheese first allows the pasta and pan to cool sufficiently, and prevents clumps from forming in the cheese.

@Red Dock Citizens I"ve talked with one of shen"s friends and we made a deal, he wanted us to stop hating on Shen, of course are we all angry over what he did but we talked about it so heres the deal: Right now we will stop hating on Shen as long as he stays out of red dock, he is KOS (kill on sight) so we can and will kill him if he sets a foot in our beautiful town, but outside the town it is illegal to kill him in the name of Red Dock. This deal was done to hopefully not risk any future conflicts, but always be on guard and report to a high ranking member if he is spotted. Have a good day and stay safe!

@everyone As some of you may have heard I am not planning to run for Red Dock Council, I have been part of the council since the very formation of it and it has been fucking amazing to see Red Dock grow from the humble hamlet it used to be to the Mega City it is now, I’ve seen it all from the building of the nether tunnels to the rise and fall of the UN, the rise of many cities and the downfall of many too. I’ve enjoyed being such an influential part of this community and I hope you enjoyed me being in it as well. I’ve met many people because of this town and made many friends because of it. A few of you know I’ve been looking to find someone else to be the mayor for a few months now and I feel the election will do that job well, I hope you choose them well. I will still be Head Admin of the Discord I just won"t be in charge of any of the Minecraft stuff. I wish this city greatness, try not to fuck it up :)

[19-Apr-19 01:09 PM] Lillwargen#7666
@everyone On a side note on what James said, As i will have to rerun to become part of the council again i will still be Admin and help out on the server, Cheers
