okay
i don't think we should let brand new people in
like less than a week on the server
the ones that spam char with WHAT TOWN DO I JOIN
because 9/10 times they  just build a shit house and quit within 5 days
so we will look like reddock very fast

[30-Apr-19 12:57 PM] Ninobf#2565
we can just evict them if we wanna

[30-Apr-19 01:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah but its that much more work and if an actual player wants to join we either have to expand more or wait 7 days for more buidling space
lets do a vote to decide if we annex vingard or not
@Ninobf

[30-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Ninobf#2565

[01-May-19 08:25 AM] Ninobf#2565
any suggestions?

[01-May-19 08:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
well im currently building roads in the mesa but when im done im gonna move to the superflat district
ill connect llamatown
i think that is where new players can build their houses
not new to oppo
new to tgn
active tgn members that move to oppo will live in the superior mesa district 

[01-May-19 08:27 AM] Ninobf#2565
lets not expand more for now
fill up the current area

[01-May-19 08:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
superflat district is weird
im not gonna try to influence it that much
it should just fall into place naturally
but i guarntee it will take a few weird turns
llamatown is so fucking weird
isnt it just one dude
who has been offline for a month?
@Ninobf
 btw there isnt room for new members to build
im gonna add a few roads
and plots
because when new people join they have nowhere to build

[01-May-19 08:33 AM] Ninobf#2565
superflat right

[01-May-19 08:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
not really
i mean that's yours and fox's decision to make

[01-May-19 08:34 AM] Ninobf#2565
top part is farms bot part is housing

[01-May-19 08:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
oppo museum is going up in the mesa district
okay that sounds good
put eviction signs on anything there that you haven't evicted yet
we need a soft reset of the superflat district
one more thing, the top half is gonna be weird for farms because those chunks arent loaded very often
which is part of why the bottom should be residential
so that the farms are always loaded

[01-May-19 08:36 AM] Ninobf#2565
yeah
prox and mesa are gonna be loaded the most right

[01-May-19 08:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes
by far
until we get more houses in the superflat

[01-May-19 08:37 AM] Ninobf#2565
maybe we can do larger projects on top, like the zoo

[01-May-19 08:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
sure
i still need to do a lot before im ready for the zoo

[01-May-19 08:37 AM] Ninobf#2565
have the farms go somewhere closer to mesa and prox

[01-May-19 08:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
i got frustrated at it in a creative world so if i mess up in survival ill probably end up scrapping it so i gotta get it right the first time
prox has the villager farm
that char and i need to finish
we just need pistons tbh
like a few stacks
thats most of the reason it isnt done lmao

[01-May-19 08:39 AM] Ninobf#2565
im gonna redraw the district map rn

[01-May-19 08:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
okay
retain the borders on the bottom half
just tweak the top to divide superflat into two districts
im still terraforming the mesa district
you know where there are weird spots of terracotta near the border where it blends with the plains?
im gonna make that homogenous terracotta
so that it looks better

mesa should have erebus lake

did i do river/mesa right?
ok sec

[01-May-19 08:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
mesa has erebus because all of the buildings on the lake are in the mesa district
and its more personal preference but proximal should have chad tower
so that the 
proximal
 part of oppo has two towers

[01-May-19 08:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
better
whats your thoughts on my previous message

mesa is elite boys 
i mean i ge tthat you want your tower in your district but geographically and logically it doesnt make sense

[01-May-19 08:43 AM] Ninobf#2565
undecided on chad tower rn

[01-May-19 08:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
chad tower is vertically much higher up than the rest of the lower part of the superflat district
and it used to be the center of opportunity

[01-May-19 08:44 AM] Ninobf#2565
yeah

[01-May-19 08:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
therefore imo it should be proximal
your part of the superflat will expand further left eventually

[01-May-19 08:44 AM] Ninobf#2565
i'll leave it like this for now

so is steam punktheme  scraped for the farming district?

[01-May-19 06:41 PM] LordPixela#2609
I think we should plan the function before we start on design

[01-May-19 06:42 PM] Ninobf#2565
fox you're in charge of the farming district
its up to you

[01-May-19 06:42 PM] FoxRaid#3227
steam punk aesthetic could easily be implemented after initial construction of farms its not a complex sesign
oh
ok then very epic
im starting construction of the katara towers in creative
then i'll see about how fast i can get it into tgn

[01-May-19 06:46 PM] LordPixela#2609

[01-May-19 06:50 PM] Ninobf#2565
depending on how big its gonna be you can leave large parts empty for residential space

[01-May-19 06:50 PM] LordPixela#2609
maybe make like a hospital/office interior
just put decorations on the side
sometimes less is more

[01-May-19 08:06 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Here is the zoning map for my district
The red area by the WOTC is going to be a pier with some yachts, the other by chad tower will be a garden and driveway, the blue squares plot is going to be large towers and the purple will be for smaller residential towers. Sorry if youre shit gets bulldozed, its not hard feelings

@SupaPenguin
 the plan you outlined goes over two houses that are owned by players so i'd recommend you plan those towers first and then exercise eminent domain
one of them is memcrisp's and he doesnt live in oppo
the other is diego's/paisley's whatever their ign is and they are actually active

[02-May-19 09:59 AM] Ninobf#2565
what is eminent domain?

[02-May-19 09:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
its an american thing
i think other countries have it
basically the government takes your land and pays you back whatever it is worth
it is usually done for roads and they just take some of your lawn
it's not that common anyways

[02-May-19 10:00 AM] Ninobf#2565
ah

[02-May-19 10:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you live on a busy road there is a higher chance you will be effected by it

guys
idea
we have to do a council vote to remove any building here before we divided into districts
other than that it is up to the district leader

[02-May-19 03:02 PM] LordPixela#2609
only buildings in my segment are smeg's, kaviars' and a few next to the canal
so I have loads of space
really it should be up to the district leader unless it's right on the border

[02-May-19 06:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
you have more
you have ninos building
and tecnas

its the same but smooth stone

so you stand there holding left click till your pick is gone

we should keep the [name] district cycle so that it isn't confusing to new players
if they all have their own format it might come across as completely seperate areas
is the banner good though

how does it work?

[03-May-19 05:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
pigmen passively walk into water streams and are dropped to their death
its actually a good exp farm
if they are aggroed they drop exp
you don’t have to have the final blow

[03-May-19 05:35 PM] LordPixela#2609
it seems pretty slow though
since they drop nuggets at best

[03-May-19 05:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
its huge
21k portal frames
and if they are aggroed they drop ingots
plus we are doubling its size

[05-May-19 02:44 PM] Ninobf#2565
i dont get why people play solo
the fun part of mp is flexing your builds
and living with others

[05-May-19 02:52 PM] FoxRaid#3227
i can make a bruh penis without anyone telling me no
i just like solo play theres nothing to it really.
im not invited anywhere either so it works out

if he promises to be more active and improve then it shouldnt be a problem

[05-May-19 04:36 PM] LordPixela#2609

[05-May-19 04:38 PM] LordPixela#2609
not everyones a talented builder
some people will want to play their own ways
oppo isn't dragonville

[05-May-19 04:38 PM] FoxRaid#3227
if he promises to get on more frequently and improve his house  it should be fine, but its your district so do whatever

no holo is literally god
i'll explain
yesterday
after the event
i was on the red highway
as usual
and rexy attacks holo
and i'm in japan vc
and everyone is like OH SHIT
REXY V HOLO
so they join in and we have like 5 guys on holo
but
then rexy starts attacking thecallmeching
and ching is one of the best non donos
he isn't even a rando
and
he is japan
ching is an all around homie gangsta
so
then japan starts attacking rexy
and holo helps
i think kerry also joined in
maybe creamy
the point is
japan and sl are on the brink of war
and japan accepted holotic
holotic is a really fun guy
and we have him on our side
he will help japan in the war
we don't hurt holo
very bad
big nono
because holo is god

nino do a head count see who has raid gear
i mean:
- God set
- God sword
- Gaps
- Totem
- God bow
- Pots
that is bare minimum for the war
after that it's personal playstyle
And again, don't go spreading shit about the war. We are the allies, not the aggressors.

[14-May-19 11:18 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
I've never had a problem with holo, never really thought of him as that big of a deal on the server
Is the war supposed to be SL vs Japan vs Oppo or SL vs Japan/Oppo. There are like 5 members of Japan who also are in Oppo for the build freedom

i remember gay baby jail
bring back smeg
ricardo would 100% be worth it
it would be the only whole map pixel art on tgn
excluding void room

[15-May-19 11:03 PM] FoxRaid#3227
yes everyone loves ricardo and not everyone likes anime
so it works out

[15-May-19 11:33 PM] FoxRaid#3227
yeah i was gonna do that first
ricardo first then border
we can get more detail on ricardos face and better colors if we can find a frame with his face bigger

[15-May-19 11:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
or manually crop
what website do you use to transfer it to blocks

he is leeving
until reset

[18-May-19 10:33 AM] Ninobf#2565
so umm
we are letting char keep his position right?

[18-May-19 10:34 AM] LordPixela#2609
take him off but say if he wants to join then we'll put him back into the council
i feel like having an inactive council member will breed discontent
maybe add someone else
wants to rejjoin the server*

[18-May-19 10:35 AM] Ninobf#2565
i can take over prox for now
i'll not do anything too major
who would you choose to replace char?

[18-May-19 10:36 AM] LordPixela#2609
is there anyone else who lives in prox who would be interested in joining?

[18-May-19 10:36 AM] Ninobf#2565

we need trade between oppo and rd

[18-May-19 05:19 PM] Ninobf#2565
we can keep these channels
and keep shitposting in rd discord
anyone against an oppo discord?
