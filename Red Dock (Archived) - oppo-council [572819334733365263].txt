oppo museum is going up in the mesa districtokay that sounds goodput eviction signs on anything there that you haven"t evicted yetwe need a soft reset of the superflat districtone more thing, the top half is gonna be weird for farms because those chunks arent loaded very oftenwhich is part of why the bottom should be residentialso that the farms are always loaded

[01-May-19 08:36 AM] Ninobf#2565
yeahprox and mesa are gonna be loaded the most right

[01-May-19 08:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
yesby faruntil we get more houses in the superflat

[01-May-19 08:37 AM] Ninobf#2565
maybe we can do larger projects on top, like the zoo

[01-May-19 08:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
surei still need to do a lot before im ready for the zoo

[01-May-19 08:37 AM] Ninobf#2565
have the farms go somewhere closer to mesa and prox

[01-May-19 08:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
i got frustrated at it in a creative world so if i mess up in survival ill probably end up scrapping it so i gotta get it right the first timeprox has the villager farmthat char and i need to finishwe just need pistons tbhlike a few stacksthats most of the reason it isnt done lmao

[01-May-19 08:39 AM] Ninobf#2565
im gonna redraw the district map rn

[01-May-19 08:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
okayretain the borders on the bottom halfjust tweak the top to divide superflat into two districtsim still terraforming the mesa districtyou know where there are weird spots of terracotta near the border where it blends with the plains?im gonna make that homogenous terracottaso that it looks better

[01-May-19 08:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
mesa has erebus because all of the buildings on the lake are in the mesa districtand its more personal preference but proximal should have chad towerso that the proximal part of oppo has two towers

mesa is elite boys i mean i ge tthat you want your tower in your district but geographically and logically it doesnt make sense

[01-May-19 08:43 AM] Ninobf#2565
undecided on chad tower rn

[01-May-19 08:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
chad tower is vertically much higher up than the rest of the lower part of the superflat districtand it used to be the center of opportunity

[01-May-19 08:44 AM] Ninobf#2565
yeah

[01-May-19 08:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
therefore imo it should be proximalyour part of the superflat will expand further left eventually

[01-May-19 06:41 PM] LordPixela#2609
I think we should plan the function before we start on design

[01-May-19 06:42 PM] Ninobf#2565
fox you"re in charge of the farming districtits up to you

[01-May-19 06:42 PM] FoxRaid#3227
steam punk aesthetic could easily be implemented after initial construction of farms its not a complex sesignohok then very epicim starting construction of the katara towers in creativethen i"ll see about how fast i can get it into tgn

depending on how big its gonna be you can leave large parts empty for residential space

[01-May-19 06:50 PM] LordPixela#2609
maybe make like a hospital/office interiorjust put decorations on the sidesometimes less is more

[01-May-19 08:06 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Here is the zoning map for my districtThe red area by the WOTC is going to be a pier with some yachts, the other by chad tower will be a garden and driveway, the blue squares plot is going to be large towers and the purple will be for smaller residential towers.

@SupaPenguin the plan you outlined goes over two houses that are owned by players so i"d recommend you plan those towers first and then exercise eminent domainone of them is memcrisp"s and he doesnt live in oppothe other is diego"s/paisley"s whatever their ign is and they are actually active

[02-May-19 07:50 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
yea but this thing makes 11 stacks a minute

[02-May-19 07:50 PM] Ninobf#2565
damnblast chamber?or just haste 2

[02-May-19 07:50 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
haste 2 eff 5using tnt would be way too expensive

[02-May-19 07:51 PM] Ninobf#2565
how to accidentally wreck your pickaxeoh right i forgot you need to dupe probably

[02-May-19 07:51 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
not a problem when you have a guardian farm 

[02-May-19 07:51 PM] Ninobf#2565
reeleaving this on for like 5 mins is enough to delete ur pick

[02-May-19 07:54 PM] FoxRaid#3227
@SupaPenguin  yes go aheadtheres no theme just make it look presentable

[02-May-19 07:54 PM] SupaPenguin#0888

whats a smooth stone generator

[02-May-19 08:17 PM] Ninobf#2565
you know what a cobble generator is right?its the same but smooth stoneand fast enough to keep up with haste 2 eff 5so you stand there holding left click till your pick is gone

[02-May-19 08:37 PM] FoxRaid#3227

I"ve never had a problem with holo, never really thought of him as that big of a deal on the serverIs the war supposed to be SL vs Japan vs Oppo or SL vs Japan/Oppo. There are like 5 members of Japan who also are in Oppo for the build freedom

so ummwe are letting char keep his position right?

[18-May-19 10:34 AM] LordPixela#2609
take him off but say if he wants to join then we"ll put him back into the councili feel like having an inactive council member will breed discontentmaybe add someone elsewants to rejjoin the server*
