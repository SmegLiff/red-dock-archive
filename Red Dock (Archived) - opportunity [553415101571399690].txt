That may workif we want perfect space it should be past the carrot kingdom tower but then it would feel disconnectedi think practicality should come before getting the perfect picture

[25-Mar-19 09:52 AM] Pansear70#2680
What

[25-Mar-19 09:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
one we get a lot of tall structures up we could make a large, above-ground road system between themit would be practical and look coolwould definitely draw people to the city as well

[25-Mar-19 09:53 AM] Pansear70#2680
Why not just build a sky city at that poiy*point

[25-Mar-19 09:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
nothing would be floatingwe would just be connecting the buildingsthe city would still mainly run on ground based infrastructure

[25-Mar-19 09:55 AM] Pansear70#2680
But it defeats the purpose of roads on the ground

[25-Mar-19 09:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
nothere are plenty of things on the grundand the number of buildings on the ground will only grow as the city growsand we wouldn"t have a ton of roads above groundjust connecting the important, high traffic buildings that would otherwise take a while to travel between

Ok, dude was annoying me at end farm. So I killed him. He had like literally nothing on him when I killed him. He came back and killed me. He was mocking me and stuff so nino killed him to get my stuff back. Then he kept spamming my messages saying I was coward and to fight him. He was being like super in my face about it and I"m not really good at pvp so nino helped me kill himIt"s really not a big deal

[27-Mar-19 11:23 AM] James B#2811

Immediately apologise and return his items to him or your citizenship may be revoked

[03-Apr-19 07:19 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
We"re giving his items back, not apologizeing. He threatend us, we dont take that lightly

[03-Apr-19 07:21 PM] Wuzado#3715
Also, do not make any more raids on the people who replied under Pen"s comment.If you won"t abort the raids, you may seriously lose your citizenship

[03-Apr-19 07:36 PM] Wuzado#3715
Okey, I believe you, but during an investigation I should be objective as much as possible. That means listening to both sides of the incident. It seems that there will be no action taken, unless someone higher than me overrides my decision, but in case of further incidents, you may have your citizenship revoked. @SupaPenguin @Deleted User

Did you see my question?

[03-Apr-19 09:41 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
nopeDid you ask if we needed anything fo the farm?

[03-Apr-19 09:41 PM] Ninobf#2565
can you maybe reconsider the automatic farm plan, i"ve  been planning to do the exact same thing for a while now

[03-Apr-19 09:41 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
@NinobfWell we already startedAnd I"m doing more than just an auto farmyou"re free to help if youd likeMe and bubby have already put 3 hours into it each

[03-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Ninobf#2565
I was gonna build a steampunk tower with farms

[03-Apr-19 09:43 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
You can still build farms if youd likeBut mine is specifically going to be made for emeralds and god sets

[03-Apr-19 09:43 PM] ninogf#8110
nino stop

[03-Apr-19 09:43 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
It will make oppo rich as fuckIt"s gonna be an assembly line of god gearYou"ll like it when were finishedWill the villager breeder still work if I remove all the bad librarians and the cartographers

[03-Apr-19 09:54 PM] FoxRaid#3227
how will it make oppo rich?are profits going to be divided amongst everyone? or will funds go towards builds

[03-Apr-19 09:55 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
It will be for public use

[03-Apr-19 09:55 PM] FoxRaid#3227
yeah

[03-Apr-19 09:55 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
It"s basically infinate emeraldsand then there will be an assembly line of god gearTo restore the god gear trades you can sell paper (will also be provided with good ass farm) or spend a couple emeralds to buy glass and if you have too, bookshelfsBooks will also be provided for trades through a leather farm laurien is going to help me withThe farm is close to spawn so that chunks will be loaded often

[03-Apr-19 09:58 PM] Ninobf#2565
Friendly reminder of the fact that we already have a 180 cane farm

[03-Apr-19 09:58 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
not spawn sorry, town centert

[03-Apr-19 09:58 PM] FoxRaid#3227
so essentially we"re making god armor and distributing it

[03-Apr-19 09:59 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Yep

[03-Apr-19 09:59 PM] FoxRaid#3227
understandable

[03-Apr-19 09:59 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Everyone will have accessI will maintain itWere also gonna be able to sell emeralds but I"m gonna limit how much you guys can sell per day so we dont crash the marketThe only thing I need to fix out is how to get a lot of xp. I"m considering a smelting grinder with kelpYeah I know we have the cane farm, but that farm is kinda a hassle and I"d like more output just to have more output cuz im fussy like thatThis farm is gonna fuel the growth of OppoI will bring in extra god trade villagers so you guys can sell books. Books just sell more than emeraldsYou guys are gonna thank me and Bubby when its finished

[03-Apr-19 10:04 PM] SupaPenguin#0888

@deleted-role If you guys want to have a sethome in the end and at opportunity you can put a bed it oppo, sleep in it then if you want to get back to Opportunity then put your inventory  in your echest. When you do /kill you will spawn back at your bed

harming arrows don"t work i believego for slowness and shid

[05-Apr-19 12:01 AM] Snekky#6713
yes

[05-Apr-19 12:02 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
its working on mobs in my single player world

[05-Apr-19 12:03 AM] Snekky#6713
if harming damage is higher than the bow, it will use harmingelse, it uses bow damageso in order to actually to harming damage you have to only draw bow back a bitwhich is actually shid

[05-Apr-19 12:04 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
how much damage does power 2 dealohso it will only ever use one of the damage values

[05-Apr-19 12:05 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
But its still usefull thoIts still usefull

nooo

[05-Apr-19 12:05 AM] Snekky#6713
very useful

[05-Apr-19 12:05 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
hear me out

[05-Apr-19 12:05 AM] Snekky#6713
ok

[05-Apr-19 12:06 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
protection doesnt prevent harming damage

[05-Apr-19 12:06 AM] Snekky#6713
yes

[05-Apr-19 12:06 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
so harming arrows will do way more damage

[05-Apr-19 12:06 AM] Snekky#6713
only if your bow does less than harming damage

[05-Apr-19 12:07 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
right

[05-Apr-19 12:07 AM] Snekky#6713
so less than 12 dmg

[05-Apr-19 12:07 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
just dont put power on it

[05-Apr-19 12:07 AM] Snekky#6713
so a bow without power will workyes

[05-Apr-19 12:07 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
that still works

[05-Apr-19 12:07 AM] Snekky#6713
so we have our standard bows and this anti tank gunim okay with this

[05-Apr-19 12:08 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
were onto something smeg

[05-Apr-19 12:08 AM] Snekky#6713
btw since the end city is gone can we summon dragon now

[05-Apr-19 12:08 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
we need 5 ghast teirs

[05-Apr-19 12:08 AM] Snekky#6713

[05-Apr-19 12:08 AM] SupaPenguin#0888

[05-Apr-19 12:08 AM] Snekky#6713
fox had an end crystal but i blew it up

[05-Apr-19 12:09 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
@deleted-role If any of you guys have ghast years please let us know! The plan is to get dragons breath so we can make harming arrows, thus negating the effects of protection. I will pay you a pretty penny

[05-Apr-19 12:09 AM] Snekky#6713
ghast yearsok so if nothing goes wrongwe use a standard bow with no power enchantmentand it will take down anyone with 3-4 hits

[05-Apr-19 12:11 AM] SupaPenguin#0888
Idk maybe that was intentional game design

also if we just build around ourselves when we place it we can"t legally be killed and lose the itemif ppl have to break blocks to kill us its bannable and it will be rolled backthats what i did when i moved the deggt0lo guarded me when i removed itand i enclosed myself in dirt when i replaced it

decide sooner rather than later becaus eif you are keeping it we should shrine it before everyone and their mom knows about itand if we are we should put it in a shrine asapso uhno pressureit’s worth over 1000 diamondswait noit’s worth what people are willing to pay for it

this one in fact:Thanos had done it. He had finally gathered all six infinity stones. Now, all he had to do was execute his plan. And after successfully tricking the entire universe to thinking his plans included genocide, resource use, all things "balance", he was free to pursue his true desire, to engage in the highest euphoria Thanos knew: a homosexual orgy comprised of every being across the cosmos that could even be remotely considered male. It was an ecstasy Thanos needed before smiling at a grateful universe.
But Thanos could not act yet. For in the distance, what he assumed to be another Earth Avenger was approaching. Fast, lightning fast.
Thor Oddinson leaped a great distance into the sky, raising his weapon above his head to strike. It was at this point that the Mad Titan knew what he was facing: the strongest, blackest, most powerful dildo he had ever seen. In the hands of such a strong, proud man....
Thanos cursed himself for allowing his mind to be distracted. Before he knew it, Thor had delivered his attack, plunging the enchanted dildo far into his purple mouth. Thanos" eyes widened in shock. Not from a threat to his life, but rather in pleasure. Thor seemed satisfied with his progress, but his expression quickly changed upon discovering the nature of Thanos" reaction.
"You should"ve aimed..." Thanos began, forgetting his mouth was muffled by the voluminous phallus plunging past his larynx. "...for this ass."

Edit: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my townI dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bot

The default dance is truly a masterpiece. Neverin all of historyhas such an artistic masterpiece ever been created. The choreography is possibly the most beautiful sight ever beheld by the human‍♂️ eye. The sharp sound of the SLAP when the player’s hands collide perfectly  with the beat of the song  sends a bone chilling️ shiver down my spine, every single time I hear it. I find my self watching my in-game avatar performing this phenomenal dance ritual for hours on end.

Okay so I spawned in playing on Xbox for the first time in years today and immediately found a village. It had cats and stuff, so I was like "nice, bet" and started doing as one does taking all the farming stuff and reselling it to them, looting the blacksmith chest, etc. I start building a house next to the village. Then a thunderstorm starts as the sun is setting and I love thunderstorms so I"m like "awesome." I finish my house then go back into town to sell some more wheat when out of nowhere a HORDE OF ZOMBIE VILLAGERS START CHASING ME! I kill them all on instinct, then see a zombie chasing a villager into his house. "Not today!" I think, and charge in to save the guy. He turns out to be the farmer, which is good because he was the most useful one to trade with at the time. But then I remembered that I had just killed a bunch of the villagers and couldn"t remember how many there were in the village. So I start looking around to see if I can find another villager to breed him with to repopulate the village, BUT THEY WERE ALL DEAD! I HAD KILLED THEM ALL WHEN THEY TURNED INTO ZOMBIES! So now I feel really bad because a single zombie had just made me slaughter an entire village beyond the possibility for rebuilding. But it gets worse. I try to sleep it off in my house, then head back to the village to see if I maybe missed one Then I hear the meowing. The villagers" cats were scattered around and making these pitiful meowing noises, and it really got to me because it sounded like they couldn"t find their owners! So I feel responsible now and I spent all of the string I had planned on making a bow with on a fishing pole and fished for ten minutes to get all the fish needed to tame the five cats. Finally I do it and lead them back to my house. They all jump on the bed and start looking at me with their big cat eyes and purring and I just lost it. I started crying and had to log out.

Oh by the way I"ve been meaning to askAre Shulker boxes any different from chests?Because idk

[14-Apr-19 06:36 AM] LordPixela#2609
shulker boxes keep items in them after you break themmaking them very useful

[14-Apr-19 06:37 AM] Sharp!Disc#9710
Ah

[14-Apr-19 06:37 AM] LordPixela#2609
if you bring an ender chest that takes 1 inventory slotyou can potentially have 27x27 more slots

[14-Apr-19 06:38 AM] Sharp!Disc#9710
Nice

[14-Apr-19 06:38 AM] LordPixela#2609
they were only so expensive before because of the end being so smallso you could easily get around 5 shulkers worth per end city you find that"s unraidedif you get unlucky

trap idea is from sethblingi just added 2 doors to this particular build to keep attackers insidenot on the tgn server though this one could be used for a server with more lenient rulessigns hold up carpet on top of themall of the signs are connected to the pison that is in the backredstone ore sends a signal out when touched or stepped onso this causes the piston to retract and break the sign

@Torviant what vpn are you using? @Ninobf The villager trades are good, me and bubby transported some of the villagers to a private location because none of you are active except tolo, who also has access. Once I have the time to finish the two other farms it will actually be popping cause you can actually get enough emeralds.

yes i hopein the report channel theres 2 othe reports of people having their beacons stolen

[23-Apr-19 06:02 PM] Ninobf#2565
only your missing stuff has been reported right?

[23-Apr-19 06:03 PM] FoxRaid#3227
i reported my stuff because thats all i sawthe egg wasnt reported because i thought one of them took itEither way back to oppo elections,  If there was anything to appreciate like nino said no body would have a problem saying thank you. But youre so entitled for a thanks for absolutely nothing. It amazes me that you think anyone would be grateful for a big build and a useless egg shrine. I personally could have done things to give oppo more resources but was told there was no need since a god armor factory was on its way. But no it was never delivered. instead villagers were taken to a private location for your own personal gain.

[23-Apr-19 06:09 PM] Ninobf#2565

[23-Apr-19 06:09 PM] FoxRaid#3227

at least give the rest of oppo access

[23-Apr-19 06:10 PM] FoxRaid#3227
to me it looks like incase you lost this election it would be fine since you have the cream of the crop with villagersif im wrong then ill admit i am but this doesnt make any sense wanting a thank you for nothing

[23-Apr-19 06:12 PM] Ninobf#2565
they were gonna do good things for oppobut leaving us with a block of stone bricks and a lot less villagers and still demanding a thank you?

[23-Apr-19 06:13 PM] FoxRaid#3227
then he threatens me to work on the pixel art or its being taken downthe literal thing that started this townhe threatens to take away

[23-Apr-19 06:13 PM] Ninobf#2565
tbf i want it moved too but never without your permission

[23-Apr-19 06:13 PM] FoxRaid#3227
i admit i put it off for too longwhat would you consider a better spot? 
my only problem is im working on it on my own placing the blocks 1 by 1 and moving it would be a pain to store and relocateif i were the head of oppo i would leave it to majority rule not strong arming

[23-Apr-19 06:15 PM] Ninobf#2565

[23-Apr-19 06:50 PM] Ninobf#2565
go ahead i guess

[23-Apr-19 06:52 PM] FoxRaid#3227
this area here, the rest will not be messed withwe are way behind in terms of community resource gatheringso im proposing a farm district open for every citizen of oppoeach member will be whitelistedin theory there should be a farm for most items when im done 
farms for items such as Iron, Gold, food items, and tradeable items that will encourage more villager trades

[24-Apr-19 12:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
because it isnt my farm

[24-Apr-19 12:23 AM] Snekky#6713
what

[24-Apr-19 12:23 AM] FoxRaid#3227
then it doesnt improve opposo it doesnt apply to this convo

[24-Apr-19 12:23 AM] Snekky#6713
lookit"s fine to work on your own projectsbut personal works don"t contribute

[24-Apr-19 12:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
its why we have been less active oppo wise this weekof course they don’t

[24-Apr-19 12:24 AM] FoxRaid#3227
i dont understand what we"re supposed to be appreciative of

[24-Apr-19 12:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
smeg your personal project has been not logging on in two weeks

[24-Apr-19 12:24 AM] Snekky#6713
and your point?

[24-Apr-19 12:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
that doing something is better than doing nothingat least personal projects make me more powerful and therefore more capable of helping opportunity

[24-Apr-19 12:25 AM] Snekky#6713
and what is your point?im not even runningi have retiredand i am looking for someone fit for the job

[24-Apr-19 12:25 AM] FoxRaid#3227
and you havent helped at allis my point

[24-Apr-19 12:25 AM] Snekky#6713
there is no point in trying to one up me

[24-Apr-19 12:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
exactly idk why you are complaining about me doing nothing for oppo when you haven’t been either

[24-Apr-19 12:26 AM] Snekky#6713
because i have to select people fit for the job?so i have to ask questions?

[24-Apr-19 12:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
this isn’t a question segment its a stupid argument that started because i didn’t place a sign down

[24-Apr-19 12:27 AM] Snekky#6713
it is a form of debatecitizens should know who they really vote for

[24-Apr-19 12:27 AM] FoxRaid#3227
for an arena that no one would use id rather i have my idea of farms that benefit everyone

[24-Apr-19 12:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
but i’ve drawn people to oppo and i’ve gotten people to build and i’ve redone our entire nether highway and char and i are working on makeing a personal opportunity highway on the nether ceiling and we are still working on the farmsplus my tower which contributes to the overall appeal of opportunityi’ve gotten the mike tyson company to move to oppoi’ve gotten dan to help is clear

[24-Apr-19 12:28 AM] FoxRaid#3227
appeal doesnt improve the undergeared in oppo

[24-Apr-19 12:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
“the undergeared”it comes down to diamonds

[24-Apr-19 12:29 AM] FoxRaid#3227
yes??? the ones who quit due to lack of resources and loss of items

[24-Apr-19 12:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
and i can’t get people diamonds faster

[24-Apr-19 12:29 AM] Snekky#6713
guess whatthe treasury was made for that

[24-Apr-19 12:29 AM] FoxRaid#3227
the farms provide a sufficient means of gettng items back

[24-Apr-19 12:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
you just ignored all the examples i gave because they weren’t a perfectly efficient way of automating what is the single most active process in the game

[24-Apr-19 12:30 AM] FoxRaid#3227
it also increases villager tradesyes the nether ceiling will give me a lot of diamondsand the new nether highway

[24-Apr-19 12:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
it will make it so that oppo members arent killed on the nether highwaythere

[24-Apr-19 12:30 AM] FoxRaid#3227
how??? there was nothing about that

[24-Apr-19 12:31 AM] Deleted User#0000

[24-Apr-19 12:34 AM] FoxRaid#3227
either way im against the arena idea it should have been talked about with active members regardless of the amount of us there are

[24-Apr-19 12:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
i understand thatbut it would draw to oppowe can slap it in the jungle

since when did arenas become a tourist attraction

[24-Apr-19 12:34 AM] FoxRaid#3227

[24-Apr-19 12:37 AM] FoxRaid#3227
this is one of the many reasons i dont trust this, i have nothing against you two but you make these decisions on your own without telling anyone. Like taking villagers from kaviars farm and taking them for your selves

[24-Apr-19 12:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
uh i told kaviars about it and he offered to unlock it for me a week prior

ok

[24-Apr-19 03:42 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
@deleted-role Me and @Deleted User are claiming Opportunity. The leaders have become inactive, and, us two and Tolo are really the only one actively playing. Red Dock has not come forward to deal with any happenings in Oppo whatsoever, and it"s time you guys let go. Please PM any of your concerns and I will happily address them

[24-Apr-19 03:43 PM] Dragon#2355

[24-Apr-19 03:43 PM] Lillwargen#7666

[24-Apr-19 03:43 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Bloody traitors

[24-Apr-19 03:44 PM] Dragon#2355
are you saying you want to become independent?

[24-Apr-19 03:44 PM] Lillwargen#7666
yeah they are

[24-Apr-19 03:44 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I"m more powerful than red dock combined

[24-Apr-19 03:44 PM] Ninobf#2565

[24-Apr-19 03:44 PM] SupaPenguin#0888

[24-Apr-19 03:44 PM] Ninobf#2565

[24-Apr-19 03:44 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
We"re going to lead the city tougather

[24-Apr-19 03:44 PM] Ninobf#2565

[24-Apr-19 03:44 PM] Dragon#2355

[24-Apr-19 03:45 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
What have you guys done in the last week to communicate with oppo

[24-Apr-19 03:45 PM] LordPixela#2609
this needs to be sorted out with everyone being aware

[24-Apr-19 03:45 PM] Lillwargen#7666
@deleted-role it seems char is apparently in charge of you now so, either you go with him or you leave oppo and come back to red dock, oppo is apparently independent now

[24-Apr-19 03:46 PM] Ninobf#2565
umm

[24-Apr-19 03:46 PM] LordPixela#2609
I had no idea that bubby and char were running

[24-Apr-19 03:46 PM] James B#2811

[24-Apr-19 03:46 PM] Juulia#5980

[24-Apr-19 03:46 PM] SupaPenguin#0888

[24-Apr-19 03:48 PM] LordPixela#2609
idc if you get wet from revolutionswe"re not doing it out of nowhereit"s a bit stupid to say "we own you now, do what we say or leave"

[24-Apr-19 03:49 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Alright

[24-Apr-19 03:49 PM] LordPixela#2609
no one would take that seriously

[24-Apr-19 03:49 PM] Ninobf#2565

[24-Apr-19 03:50 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I"ve legit supported the town so much

[24-Apr-19 03:50 PM] LordPixela#2609
and then both sides do this

[24-Apr-19 03:50 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Nino you dont even fucking playI dont wanna go to japan cuz I cant build and twin peaks is kinda dead"

[24-Apr-19 03:51 PM] Ninobf#2565
too fucking bad because you"re not welcome in oppo either

[24-Apr-19 03:51 PM] LordPixela#2609
nino I know you"ve been in oppo longer but everyone"s opinions should be heardthat does not mean that you can coup out of nowhere char

[24-Apr-19 03:52 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I give @deleted-role a week to sort Opportunity out, including elections. If nothing happens me and bubby are gonna take oppo, hopefully but we"ll use force if needed

[24-Apr-19 03:52 PM] Ninobf#2565
elections are tomorrow matemaybe see what comes out of that first

[24-Apr-19 03:52 PM] Lillwargen#7666
char, you said earlier that we havent done shit to help oppo, let me reverse the question, what have oppo done for us?

[24-Apr-19 03:53 PM] LordPixela#2609
there needs to be more support both ways clearly

[24-Apr-19 03:53 PM] Ninobf#2565
afaik char left us with his own egg and a stone brick block with a half functional farm

[24-Apr-19 03:53 PM] LordPixela#2609
in the 2 weeks that oppo was a superpower we completely ignored our parent town

[24-Apr-19 03:53 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Homie

[24-Apr-19 03:54 PM] Ninobf#2565
we weren"t a superpower we just tricked the japs and o8f into thinking we were

[24-Apr-19 03:54 PM] LordPixela#2609
we need to decide what we will actually do, instead of letting it rise up to a boiling point and throwing names

[24-Apr-19 03:54 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
SureI can be reasonableBut people need to be active again so I have motivation on continue working

[24-Apr-19 03:54 PM] LordPixela#2609
and the "we give you a week"you"re a part of oppo

[24-Apr-19 03:54 PM] Juulia#5980

[24-Apr-19 03:57 PM] Juulia#5980
@Lillwargen id say oppo sticking with us through the absolute failure of the ladt council is a pretty big thing

[24-Apr-19 03:58 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Not really since they couldn"t leave since snekky was admiral

[24-Apr-19 03:59 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
What have I done?

[24-Apr-19 03:59 PM] Lillwargen#7666

[24-Apr-19 03:59 PM] SupaPenguin#0888

[24-Apr-19 04:00 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Because the only three active people have access to that location

[24-Apr-19 04:00 PM] Lillwargen#7666
I would rather have a dead discord than a bunch of traitors

[24-Apr-19 04:00 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Maybe not begged

[24-Apr-19 04:13 PM] Ninobf#2565
our opinions on what is best for oppo seem to differnot necessarily for or againsti am against this coup

[24-Apr-19 04:14 PM] Pansear70#2680
Everyone in Rd should just move to oppo

[24-Apr-19 04:14 PM] Ninobf#2565
let the elections happen

[24-Apr-19 04:15 PM] Pansear70#2680
Boom now oppo is fill and active again

[24-Apr-19 04:15 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
It"s not a coupI wanna leave peacefullyBut when are they going to happen

[24-Apr-19 04:15 PM] Ninobf#2565
of course the one staging the coup says its not a coup

[24-Apr-19 04:15 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
It"s notwho is the leader?

[24-Apr-19 04:15 PM] Ninobf#2565
snek atmsoon whoever wins the election

[24-Apr-19 04:16 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Snek hasn"t done anything recently

[24-Apr-19 04:16 PM] Ninobf#2565
so what

[24-Apr-19 04:16 PM] Lillwargen#7666
@SupaPenguin also where was this election held? Because I read this chat everyday and never seen any form of election take place, only heard about it

[24-Apr-19 04:16 PM] Ninobf#2565
he is still the leaderin this room lil

[24-Apr-19 04:16 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
They made an attempt at elections when I bugged them for an hour to do so

[24-Apr-19 04:17 PM] LordPixela#2609
honestly if it didn"t even ping anyone from oppo or council is it an election?

[24-Apr-19 04:17 PM] Ninobf#2565
sec digging up the rest of the info

[24-Apr-19 04:18 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Yep that ping I saw, but nothing else

[24-Apr-19 04:18 PM] Ninobf#2565
i do admit its a bit lackluster

[24-Apr-19 04:18 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
What did you say"independence"

[24-Apr-19 04:19 PM] Ninobf#2565
this is outdatedwait

[24-Apr-19 04:19 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
bruh

[24-Apr-19 04:19 PM] Ninobf#2565
i retreated from the election since then

[24-Apr-19 04:19 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
And jaxon isn"t in oppo

[24-Apr-19 04:19 PM] Ninobf#2565
im not sure on the independence now, i just dont want it under your and ogs reignas i told you it is outdated

[24-Apr-19 04:19 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
What have me and og done wrong?We"ve only supported the colony

[24-Apr-19 04:20 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Taking it by force is not counting as supported

[24-Apr-19 04:20 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I dont want to take it by forceI wan"t to leave peacefullyI said if I had tooI gotta goAs I said

[24-Apr-19 04:21 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Well the thing is you can"t leave, too many people are against it

[24-Apr-19 04:21 PM] Ninobf#2565
literally everyone but 2 people is against youmaybe just 1 im not sure

[24-Apr-19 04:22 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
If you wanna keep us then be active, let us know what the plan is

[24-Apr-19 04:22 PM] Ninobf#2565
do we want to keep you thomaybe its the best for everyone if you leave for another townwith oglet the rest sort this out

[24-Apr-19 04:23 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Char let me just tell you that if you leave, well, have fun with their, o8f, etcTheo*

[24-Apr-19 04:23 PM] Ninobf#2565
theo is permabanned

[24-Apr-19 04:23 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Is he?

[24-Apr-19 04:23 PM] Ninobf#2565
yeah

[24-Apr-19 04:23 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Damn

[24-Apr-19 04:23 PM] Ninobf#2565
unless it has been revoked in the last 2 days

[24-Apr-19 04:24 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Damnit

[24-Apr-19 04:24 PM] Ninobf#2565
dont think sootherwise we"d notice the massive outcry

[24-Apr-19 04:24 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Fucking hell overfast, what a peace of shit

[24-Apr-19 04:24 PM] Ninobf#2565
btw dont forget char isnt speaking for oppojust for himself og and maybe tolo

[24-Apr-19 04:25 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Yeah I have understood that

[24-Apr-19 04:25 PM] Ninobf#2565
okay good

[24-Apr-19 04:25 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Why did they ban Theo tho?

[24-Apr-19 04:25 PM] Ninobf#2565
he livestreamed himself bypassing pvp protectionidiot

[24-Apr-19 04:26 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Oh okIt"s just kinda sad tbh

[24-Apr-19 04:26 PM] Ninobf#2565
?

[24-Apr-19 04:27 PM] Cipicao#0001
welpjaxon didn"t make it to the councilbut he gets my vote

[24-Apr-19 04:27 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Well, meanwhile everyone was busy hating him and stuff, I actually befriended him in one way or another, he have never even hit me because I was one of the few people he liked

[24-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Cipicao#0001
same

[24-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Lillwargen#7666
@Ninobf

[24-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Cipicao#0001
i even saved him from suffocationnot knowing who he even is, finding out later

[24-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Ninobf#2565
he attacked me at least 10 times and didnt kill me once

[24-Apr-19 04:29 PM] Cipicao#0001
theo visited bruh inc and put a sign

[24-Apr-19 04:29 PM] Lillwargen#7666
I genuinely don"t dislike Theo, I actually saw him as a friend

[24-Apr-19 04:30 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I don"t want to leave tho

[24-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Ninobf#2565
he got away with too much shit thobefore he was banned

[24-Apr-19 04:30 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I really like Opportunity as a town

[24-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Lillwargen#7666
Well then don"t fuck it up by leaving char

[24-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Ninobf#2565
then maybe you should have waited for the election instead of threatening to take it by force

[24-Apr-19 04:33 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Then tell us what you"re going to doWhen will the election beHow will it be doneI wan"t to get people attention

[24-Apr-19 04:34 PM] Ninobf#2565
election is tomorrowi admit it was not clear enough thoask snek

[24-Apr-19 04:34 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
@Snekky When, where and how is the election going to be done

[24-Apr-19 04:35 PM] Ninobf#2565
he"ll wake up in a few hours

[24-Apr-19 04:55 PM] FoxRaid#3227
ive expressed multiple times i was running

[24-Apr-19 04:56 PM] Ninobf#2565
ree

[24-Apr-19 04:57 PM] FoxRaid#3227
and your claims of me not being active recently arent entirely wrong. Ive had things to do IRLi dont have time to be on the server 24/7 at most i have 1-3 hours unless i play something elseive also been active this weeki was banned for 1 day due to a false ban by muzakclaiming ive been inactive this whole week is wrong

[24-Apr-19 04:59 PM] Juulia#5980
Im probably wrong but i thought he said smeg wasnt active?

[24-Apr-19 05:00 PM] Ninobf#2565
and me

[24-Apr-19 05:00 PM] Juulia#5980
Ya not you fox

[24-Apr-19 05:01 PM] Ninobf#2565
theres a reason why snek is holding elections and i stopped runningso idk what char was getting at with saying we are inactive

[24-Apr-19 05:01 PM] FoxRaid#3227
no he said that towards me
"I saw nothing from smeg about fox running"
"Fox got banned
Hasnt been here for a week"
"And he has been very active since"

[24-Apr-19 05:01 PM] Ninobf#2565
ohoof

[24-Apr-19 05:01 PM] FoxRaid#3227
i was on all day yesterday gathering resourcesso either he doesnt know that ive been online recently or he was just lying in the momentive been on at the same time as him aswell

[24-Apr-19 05:02 PM] Ninobf#2565
both partially i think

[24-Apr-19 05:09 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Sorry @FoxRaid I guess I missed you. I did support you in removing your ban aswell

[24-Apr-19 05:10 PM] FoxRaid#3227
yes I saw which was why i was confused as to why you would say that.

[24-Apr-19 05:11 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
My badIf independence isn"t supported, I understandBut I wan"t people to come backIt"s been really sadning to see people leave and I guess it just made me frustrated and upset

[24-Apr-19 05:17 PM] Nick (Tolo)#2403
bruh i wake up to thisI agree though I dont like people leaving

[24-Apr-19 05:18 PM] Juulia#5980
Agree for independence?@Nick (Tolo)

[24-Apr-19 05:19 PM] Ninobf#2565
this isnt necessarily about independence, this is about fox or char/og getting to rule oppo

[24-Apr-19 05:20 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
^If council can take some initiative and ownership for rdthen I don"t necessarily want independence

[24-Apr-19 05:21 PM] Juulia#5980
Trying to do that

[24-Apr-19 05:21 PM] Ninobf#2565
i"ll ask snek to postpone the election by a day and make it clearer

[24-Apr-19 05:21 PM] FoxRaid#3227
yes i understand. For most people their reasoning for leaving is their inability to fight back to higher powers on the server. losing items that my colony members worked countless hours for just to be cut down at random by some overzealous PVP player is exhausting . Im sure you can understand that right?when you first joined i was promised the ability to no longer have to worry about that.

[24-Apr-19 05:22 PM] Ninobf#2565
i put my own farming projects on hold for it

[24-Apr-19 05:23 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I never promised thatI promised to work on a god farmpart of the farm is just luckI have to wait for the right villagers too breedI probably havent done as much work as I could have

[24-Apr-19 05:23 PM] FoxRaid#3227
god farm implies infinite god armor sets

[24-Apr-19 05:24 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Yes it doesBut it"s not automatic

[24-Apr-19 05:24 PM] FoxRaid#3227
when you promise a "god armor factory" thats what people think theyre getting

[24-Apr-19 05:24 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
it"s not finishedAnd like I saidpart of it is luck

[24-Apr-19 05:24 PM] Ninobf#2565
were you waiting for perfect trades?

[24-Apr-19 05:25 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Not perfecI just got a mending trade

[24-Apr-19 05:25 PM] FoxRaid#3227
like your running mate said. He wanted clarity on ideas we havewe also want clarity

[24-Apr-19 05:25 PM] Ninobf#2565
^

[24-Apr-19 05:25 PM] FoxRaid#3227
it goes both ways

[24-Apr-19 05:25 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Do you need me to explain the farm?

[24-Apr-19 05:25 PM] Ninobf#2565
no

[24-Apr-19 05:25 PM] FoxRaid#3227
but instead we find out its going towards a private locations

[24-Apr-19 05:26 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Because I felt people wern"t activeaka it wont be usedIf you wan"t me to move the mending villager back I canas for the unb 3 villager, I don"t own that one

[24-Apr-19 05:27 PM] Ninobf#2565
i dont see the problem in just keeping them at oppoinstead of a private location

[24-Apr-19 05:27 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Because I had other people who wanted to use themIf you guys could express some concern, or be active  as I said I would be happy to move them back

[24-Apr-19 05:28 PM] FoxRaid#3227
how could we express concern when nobody knew what was happening

[24-Apr-19 05:28 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
AskLitterally

[24-Apr-19 05:29 PM] LordPixela#2609
char, if you say there will be a god gear farm, it should be a pretty clear idea to tell the people a change in the plan

[24-Apr-19 05:29 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I was plenty willing to give out info, as I just did

[24-Apr-19 05:29 PM] FoxRaid#3227
ah yes i will ask multiple questions about random topics

[24-Apr-19 05:29 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I"m not asking you to do that

[24-Apr-19 05:29 PM] FoxRaid#3227
also

[24-Apr-19 05:29 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Do you want me to move the mending villager back to oppo?I"m happy to do it

[24-Apr-19 05:29 PM] FoxRaid#3227
whenever i message you on tgn you never reply so why should i attempt it anywhere else

[24-Apr-19 05:29 PM] LordPixela#2609
this should be a real talk please

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Discord works better

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] FoxRaid#3227
im literally in the same game as you

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I"m not always glued to the chat in mc

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] LordPixela#2609
After we"re done blaming can oppo sit down and discuss its future

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
^

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] FoxRaid#3227
its usually in big yellow letters

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Ninobf#2565
pixel are you running?

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] LordPixela#2609
idkI want to see what the current plans arefor everyone

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I"m sorry I don"t see it

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Ninobf#2565
the plans are wait for the election

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] LordPixela#2609
I won"t run if I don"t see a problem

[24-Apr-19 05:30 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I"m usually working on somethingDiscord is better because it stays there

[24-Apr-19 05:31 PM] LordPixela#2609
please ping a few people if it"s relevant to them

[24-Apr-19 05:31 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
But why do we need to wait for the election to have a discussion

[24-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Ninobf#2565
i didnt mean that

[24-Apr-19 05:31 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
The election needs to be included in the discussion

[24-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Ninobf#2565
we can discuss our plans obviously

[24-Apr-19 05:31 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
It"s very vague and confusing at this point

[24-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Ninobf#2565
but the election will determine whos plans are actually gonna happen

[24-Apr-19 05:32 PM] FoxRaid#3227
ive talked about plans all day yesterday concerning a farm districtid move my home there so the chunks stay loaded

[24-Apr-19 05:32 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Sorry I was busy yesterdayIt was my mothers birthday

[24-Apr-19 05:32 PM] FoxRaid#3227
okanyways thats what i have for future plans

[24-Apr-19 05:33 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
If you guys wan"t the farm to be up and running as fast as possibleI would love help buildingoppo hasn"t been raided for a while

[24-Apr-19 05:33 PM] FoxRaid#3227
the problem we all have is lack of clarity between each other

[24-Apr-19 05:33 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Then let"s talk againI miss the days when we were all talkingThis discord hasn"t really been active for a little while

[24-Apr-19 05:34 PM] Ninobf#2565
the shitposting is still going on

[24-Apr-19 05:35 PM] Cipicao#0001
can we just agree on my pointwill solve the oppo problemand the rd citizen problem

[24-Apr-19 05:36 PM] FoxRaid#3227
So currently on the new flattened area i proposed that plot to be a farm district consisting of an iron , gold, and other items.
this would increase player wealth by turning to the villager farm and trading items recieved from the farms in the farming district 
players can then sell any items of worth at their own discretion

[24-Apr-19 05:36 PM] Cipicao#0001
gay

[24-Apr-19 05:36 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Great idea!

[24-Apr-19 05:36 PM] Cipicao#0001
in the long run that will crash the market if abused

[24-Apr-19 05:36 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
The melon and pumpkin farms can be easily moved

[24-Apr-19 05:36 PM] FoxRaid#3227
i dont care about the market only oppo and rd citizens

[24-Apr-19 05:37 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
But I do kinda want to go for a factory aethstetic

[24-Apr-19 05:37 PM] Cipicao#0001
well i live off the free market you mongloidso don"t do that

[24-Apr-19 05:37 PM] FoxRaid#3227
then youll have to get with the times old man

[24-Apr-19 05:37 PM] Ninobf#2565
join oppo reee

[24-Apr-19 05:37 PM] Cipicao#0001

[24-Apr-19 05:37 PM] FoxRaid#3227

[24-Apr-19 05:37 PM] Cipicao#0001
2 i ain"t moving my basecause it"s huge

[24-Apr-19 05:38 PM] FoxRaid#3227
char a factory asthetic is what i want that district to look like

[24-Apr-19 05:38 PM] Ninobf#2565
is the epic living room i made for you still there?

[24-Apr-19 05:38 PM] Cipicao#0001
yes

[24-Apr-19 05:38 PM] Ninobf#2565
yay

[24-Apr-19 05:38 PM] FoxRaid#3227
just absolutely huge factories churning out materials

[24-Apr-19 05:38 PM] Ninobf#2565
i like

[24-Apr-19 05:38 PM] LordPixela#2609
guys I"ll help you with the building of that"s what we"re working on

[24-Apr-19 05:38 PM] Cipicao#0001
smh

[24-Apr-19 05:38 PM] LordPixela#2609
I didn"t play because there was nothing I could contribute to

[24-Apr-19 05:38 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Bet @FoxRaid

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] Cipicao#0001
you have to take down buildings

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Let"s do it

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] Cipicao#0001
not make more

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] FoxRaid#3227
i also propose a underground highway under oppo

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] LordPixela#2609
let"s allocate space first

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] FoxRaid#3227
making travel around much faster

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] LordPixela#2609
we have an emergency tunnel for now

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I think want the pumpkin farm to go to bedrock

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] Cipicao#0001
well this is fucking pointless

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
and melon farm

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] Cipicao#0001
welpanime time

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] LordPixela#2609
and honestly a highway feels too large-scale to be relevant on a small town like oppo

[24-Apr-19 05:39 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
so i"m gonna use a bubble column to bring the items upThe biggest challenge is an xp farm

[24-Apr-19 05:40 PM] LordPixela#2609
melons fill up chests extremely quickly char

[24-Apr-19 05:40 PM] FoxRaid#3227
we can allocate ice from the snow biome near llama town

[24-Apr-19 05:40 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
But I think a gold farm can fix that

[24-Apr-19 05:40 PM] LordPixela#2609
I have I think 8 melonsxp farmhmmall xp farms are based on tps tbh

[24-Apr-19 05:40 PM] Ninobf#2565
furnace?

considering the steampunk factory district, in order to have all farms active at one time ill have a house in the sky. this house will be an air blimp about maybe 20 blocks long and somewhere at y200to keep the themeand stay out of the way of any potential farms

[24-Apr-19 07:39 PM] Ninobf#2565
i like blimps

[24-Apr-19 07:39 PM] Pansear70#2680

from pixel: "nino" this word echoed throughout #deleted-channel, the most recent coming from none other than nino"s mc waifu. James was astonished when he heard her vote, exclaiming that no one could"ve expected this turn of events. as the last few people saw what Valerie had to say before it got swallowed up in the fog of message history, all could be seen with a look of great shock and terror as val"s choice physically breaks the ground with its unexpectedness

hahah I can do that, but I"d rather pay someone to build it for meI do all the redstone thoughThat"s my expertiseI"m not too sure how the economy works on here, that"s why I"m asking

[29-Apr-19 05:52 PM] Ninobf#2565
we"d like to keep unneeded redstone to a minimum

[29-Apr-19 05:52 PM] Onyx#4801

[29-Apr-19 08:46 PM] ninogf#8110
Oh ok that’s fine if it’s just the center

[29-Apr-19 08:46 PM] Onyx#4801
The height is what adds to it.YESYES

[29-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Ninobf#2565
the highest you can get in oppo is 175our ground level is really high

[29-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Juulia#5980
Just make the palace instead

[29-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Onyx#4801
I"ll check the size on that rnI"m thinking of a cathedral, similar to the Russian one

[29-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Ninobf#2565

[29-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Dragon#2355
So uhh did you guys build these

[29-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Juulia#5980
Pls nino let us build it

[29-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Onyx#4801
No, I"m asking if I can build this.

[29-Apr-19 09:12 PM] Dragon#2355
Is it your build

[29-Apr-19 09:12 PM] Onyx#4801
Nino loseb asked if we could do the Kremlin, so I offered this.

[29-Apr-19 09:12 PM] Ninobf#2565
not in oppo

[29-Apr-19 09:12 PM] Onyx#4801
oof

[29-Apr-19 09:12 PM] Ninobf#2565
not the place for that kind of build imo

[29-Apr-19 09:12 PM] Onyx#4801
So why don"t I go and scale down the Burj Khalifa?

[29-Apr-19 09:12 PM] Dragon#2355
Did you make it, is it your own build

[29-Apr-19 09:12 PM] Ninobf#2565
i like the burj khalifa tho

[29-Apr-19 09:13 PM] Onyx#4801
Same, I like it tooI"d just need to scale it down, which I can do in MCEdit

[29-Apr-19 09:14 PM] Onyx#4801
@Dragon  I haven"t built it, no, to answer your question. I really don"t want to build it twice, once in creative and once on the server :DBurj Khalifa in questionI"d pay people to help me build it. I have the diamonds necessary.Anywayyyyy what are your thoughts?

[29-Apr-19 09:22 PM] Onyx#4801
@Dragon  YOU"RE the person that everyone recommended I talk to! I just remembered.

[29-Apr-19 09:23 PM] Dragon#2355
Hmm? Is that soWhat you need

[29-Apr-19 09:32 PM] Onyx#4801
Um, assistance doing this big of a project.I"m not sure how much this normally costs as well@DragonHow much do you think a build like this will cost? The main materials are light grey terracotta and light grey stained glass.

[29-Apr-19 09:33 PM] Dragon#2355
EhhhHow are you gonna do this thoAre you gonna copy it or smth

[29-Apr-19 09:34 PM] Onyx#4801
I"m going to have to shorten it by 90 bloksSo I"ll shorten each level proportionally

[29-Apr-19 09:35 PM] Dragon#2355
That sounds like a pain in the assOofWell hmm lookI like the ideaBut im kinda burnt out, really just waiting for the reset

[29-Apr-19 09:39 PM] Onyx#4801
@Dragon  How much would it cost you and/or another team for simply the labor hours spent building it?

[29-Apr-19 09:39 PM] Juulia#5980
Exept on birthdays holidays ect

[29-Apr-19 09:40 PM] Dragon#2355
Onyx how many blocks wide and high is it@Onyx

[29-Apr-19 09:41 PM] Onyx#4801
Yup, measuring now

[29-Apr-19 09:41 PM] Dragon#2355
k

[29-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Onyx#4801
170 tall maximum (which I want to reach, but that"s the world height)

[29-Apr-19 09:43 PM] Dragon#2355
Instead of squeezing it how about making it deeper and terraforming

[29-Apr-19 09:43 PM] Onyx#4801
105 longYes, that seems like a good ideaBut we"d have to terraform 73 blocks downThe og build starts at y=3

[29-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Ninobf#2565
lol

[29-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Onyx#4801

[29-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Ninobf#2565
lets not do that

[29-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Onyx#4801
Yeah, so I"ll make it 170 tall instead

[29-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Dragon#2355
Anyway you asked how much it will be

[29-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Onyx#4801
Yes! 170 tall by 105 long by 105 sidewide

@Ninobf  Where would you like me  to build the Burj? Currently Bubby is going to build his residential district in the Mesa near 2, and I believe someone is building something in 1, but I"m not sure. Where would you like me to start building? I need about 150 by 150 blocks of space (I could probably scale it down, but I think it would look better with a lobby, etc.)Could 4 work?

@Ninobf  oof theres my autism in action@Ninobf  But seriously, I plan on starting production soon, so whenever you want me to start just let me know :)also, I"ve designed fully auto farming systems for the farming district if you"d want me to implement them when that gets built upCan be built as far horizontally or vertically as you"d need (though it works better when built up vertically)

[30-Apr-19 03:54 PM] Onyx#4801
A piston, a redstone torch, and a piece of redstone dustThat"s itIt doesn"t technically use a glitch, but it uses burnt out torches as a sort of block update

[30-Apr-19 03:54 PM] Ninobf#2565
burnout torches are laggy as fuck right

[30-Apr-19 03:54 PM] Onyx#4801
Nah"

[30-Apr-19 03:55 PM] Ninobf#2565
my biggest concern with the farming district is lagi want to prioritise performance over efficiency

[30-Apr-19 03:56 PM] Onyx#4801
At least here, I drop about 10 frames (with my shaders only getting 60 on normal). Additionally, if we build it up more than across, it gets less laggy.Then the whole row doesn"t update, just the small vertical row.And it only drops frames whenever a melon spawns, for about 5 ticks

nomending is expensive

[03-May-19 08:56 AM] LordPixela#2609
mhmit"ll take like 3-4 diamonds to fix the shovel using an anvil

[03-May-19 08:56 AM] Onyx#4801
how much does mending costalso how do you repair tools

[03-May-19 08:57 AM] LordPixela#2609
normally mending costs about 4-6 diamonds but there"s short stock rn cause nsa killed most villagersand repairing tools goes like thisput the tool in the left side of the anvilput either the same tool or its material (e.g. iron/diamond/gold) on the rightand it"ll keep its enchantments
