[09-Apr-19 11:26 AM] LordPixela#2609
New oppo Park being the renovated one?what kind of trees should we dojust oak or what

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Pansear70#2680
AcaciaFits the theme

Dark oak?

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] LordPixela#2609
it shouldn"t be only acacia

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Pansear70#2680

[09-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Ninobf#2565
we dont know if thats gonna lastjust keep this name

[09-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Ninobf#2565
we need an xp farm

[09-Apr-19 02:05 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I will make one if anyone can find an ocean monument

[09-Apr-19 02:06 PM] Ninobf#2565
i was thinking of a smelter based farm

[09-Apr-19 02:06 PM] James B#2811
i was planning to make a guardian farm

[09-Apr-19 02:06 PM] Ninobf#2565
but a guardian farm would be amazing

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] James B#2811
problem is finding a monument

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Ninobf#2565
yeah

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] James B#2811
i know SL has one

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Ninobf#2565
annex time

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] James B#2811
pencylz owns it

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Ninobf#2565
do we know of any witch huts

[09-Apr-19 02:08 PM] LordPixela#2609
aren"t witches inefficient

[09-Apr-19 02:08 PM] James B#2811
ah witch farms thats gonna be a pain with the mob cap and they are a pain anyways also you would need to afk it

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] LordPixela#2609
they can drop ghasf tears tho right

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Ninobf#2565
no

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] James B#2811
people only rlly make em for red stone

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Ninobf#2565
they drop glowstone right

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] James B#2811
yup

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Ninobf#2565
and sticks for infinite fuel

[09-Apr-19 02:10 PM] James B#2811
yeah but as i said mob cap alot of effort and you would be kicked for afk

[09-Apr-19 02:10 PM] Ninobf#2565
yeah :(any other ideas?

[09-Apr-19 02:11 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I might be able to fix up a smelter design based on kelp

[09-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Ninobf#2565
nicecactus farm would also be nice

[09-Apr-19 02:11 PM] James B#2811
guardian is reletively easy just lot of time and mob cap shouldnt effect it too much

[09-Apr-19 02:12 PM] Ninobf#2565
but finding one

[09-Apr-19 02:12 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
yee

[09-Apr-19 02:12 PM] James B#2811
there is a kelp farm in red dock but its unused

[09-Apr-19 02:12 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I can try to buy coords

[09-Apr-19 02:12 PM] James B#2811
or get an ocean monument mapif they work

[09-Apr-19 02:13 PM] Ninobf#2565
a furnace xp farm would be idealwe can build it in oppo

[09-Apr-19 02:14 PM] James B#2811
yeah but they aint the fastest

[09-Apr-19 02:14 PM] Ninobf#2565
truethey"ll be loaded a lot tho

[09-Apr-19 02:15 PM] LordPixela#2609
Idk about that onewe"d end up using a lot of coalor we"d need tons of trees

[09-Apr-19 02:15 PM] James B#2811
kelp

[09-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Ninobf#2565
^how big is the red dock kelp farm?

[09-Apr-19 02:17 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Yea am ocean monument might workcuz it doesnt matter if its raider or not does it

[09-Apr-19 02:17 PM] James B#2811
its decent size i might need to do some maintenence tho

[09-Apr-19 02:18 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
the map

[09-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Ninobf#2565
how many plants?

[09-Apr-19 02:18 PM] James B#2811
i dunno if monument maps work tho being pregen and all

[09-Apr-19 02:18 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
it might not work cuz of custom genyee

[09-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Ninobf#2565
pretty sure they are broken yeah

[09-Apr-19 02:19 PM] James B#2811
ive put in a request to mapping corps for monument locations

[09-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Ninobf#2565
nice

[09-Apr-19 02:21 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
ty

[09-Apr-19 02:22 PM] James B#2811
apparently most of em have been claimed ill work on it

[09-Apr-19 03:22 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I will buy oneWe should make the appelago on the west coast of oppo into japanlike shape it like japan

[09-Apr-19 03:23 PM] LordPixela#2609
like irl japan?

[09-Apr-19 03:23 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
yeaterraform itWe would need a shit tonne of sand but thats not that hard

[09-Apr-19 03:24 PM] James B#2811
i love terraforming for some reason

[09-Apr-19 03:26 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
we could build scaffolding in the shape of japan and the drop the sand into the ocean

[09-Apr-19 03:26 PM] Wuzado#3715
Maybe

[09-Apr-19 03:28 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
it already kinda looks like japanI think it would be dopewe could make mount fuji

[09-Apr-19 04:24 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Ws could still make big cherry blossoms without them appearing on the map aswell, we would just put grasa blocks at the build limit over the pink blocks

[09-Apr-19 04:26 PM] Ninobf#2565
why would we wantt to hide them?

[09-Apr-19 06:00 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
becausw it would look ugly having pink dots on the mapbecause it wont be to scale

[09-Apr-19 06:01 PM] Ninobf#2565
having ffloating grass is even worse

[09-Apr-19 06:15 PM] James B#2811
or just have the grass for when during mapping

[09-Apr-19 06:30 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
how? @Ninobfit would be at build height so you wouldnt really see it

[09-Apr-19 06:42 PM] Ninobf#2565
everything in opppo is build heightyou"re supposed to look up

[09-Apr-19 06:43 PM] James B#2811
^

[09-Apr-19 07:12 PM] Snekky#6713
nice

[09-Apr-19 07:53 PM] SupaPenguin#0888

its a shame that we cant recreate the cloud thing the citadel hasnot knowing how high it is because it disappears in the clouds

[27-Apr-19 09:27 PM] James B#2811
looootta cobwebssurround it in a shit ton of cobwebs so you cant see the top and cant get to it

[27-Apr-19 09:30 PM] FoxRaid#3227
you could stack multiple layers of black - white stained glassgiving a fog effectbutyou"d have to do that around the tower using a lot of sandalso it might look unnatural in the sky with only one building there

[27-Apr-19 09:32 PM] Ninobf#2565
yeah thats gonna look really inconsistent

its gonna be scaled down for minecraft build limitalso considering its top is never seen im gonna stop just above the cloudsaccording to the model i sent its 10x as high as it is wide

[29-Apr-19 06:32 PM] FoxRaid#3227
ok since libtards didn"t get my artistic drawing the yellow circle is where it will be since its base is in shallow water. From there maybe a bridge could go under the tower and connecting oppo with this small island on the  right sideyay or nay

But seriously, I plan on starting production soon, so whenever you want me to start just let me know :)
also, I"ve designed fully auto farming systems for the farming district if you"d want me to implement them when that gets built upA piston, a redstone torch, and a piece of redstone dust
That"s it
It doesn"t technically use a glitch, but it uses burnt out torches as a sort of block update

[30-Apr-19 03:58 PM] Onyx#4801
At least here, I drop about 10 frames (with my shaders only getting 60 on normal). Additionally, if we build it up more than across, it gets less laggy.
Then the whole row doesn"t update, just the small vertical row.
And it only drops frames whenever a melon spawns, for about 5 ticksWhats the color of chad tower?

@Ninobf  What type of blocks would you recommend for it? It"s actually like, 40 stacks for just the first levelI"m probably going to do stone brick, as concrete is expensive as fuuuuuuckI might use it for the floor though

[01-May-19 09:35 PM] Ninobf#2565
alrightconcrete isnt expensive at all tho

[01-May-19 09:37 PM] Juulia#5980

very nice

[04-May-19 07:11 AM] LordPixela#2609
what does it do?

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] Onyx#4801
So, every time you have a "headphone jack", right, it"s a DAC (digital analog converter)The one in your phone, has a dac

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] LordPixela#2609
ah right

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] Onyx#4801
the dongle from lighting to aux, dac

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] LordPixela#2609
yeah I didn"t know what dac stood foryee I kinda know how it works

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] Onyx#4801
The audio on your motherboard, ye

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] LordPixela#2609
how come just a dac and not an amp as well?

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] Onyx#4801
So this DAC basically has a better chip than the rest. oh i"ll send pics of my amp just gimme a minute

[04-May-19 07:13 AM] LordPixela#2609
aight

[04-May-19 07:13 AM] Onyx#4801
Anyway better chip = less noise

[04-May-19 07:13 AM] LordPixela#2609
mhmalthough it"s only noticeable if you have good headphones

[04-May-19 07:13 AM] Onyx#4801
or speakers for what I usually usethe image is still loading

[04-May-19 07:13 AM] LordPixela#2609
mhm

[04-May-19 07:14 AM] LordPixela#2609
I mean you seem like an audiophile so I understand why you use speakers but Idk why regular gamers seem to have them over headphones
Attachment: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/563112874591911937/574191977529212929/image0.jpg

[04-May-19 07:15 AM] Onyx#4801
idk either. Just to be clear tho, speakers aren"t necessarily better than headphones. I only have 2 sets of speakers, and if you scroll up I have.....too many headphones. I just used to prefer the sound of headphones to speakers, until I got this pair of Elacs I have today

[04-May-19 07:15 AM] Ninobf#2565
headphones>speakers bc i live with others

[04-May-19 07:15 AM] LordPixela#2609
I mean for music speakers are generally bettercause you have real surround sound

[04-May-19 07:16 AM] Onyx#4801
eh, pixela if you"ve tried an open back headphone its pretty different

[04-May-19 07:16 AM] LordPixela#2609
I want to buy a pair of sennheiser 598 sr"s but they got more expensiveon amazon

[04-May-19 07:16 AM] Onyx#4801
What"s your budget? I"m a headphone god when it comes to knowledge

[04-May-19 07:16 AM] LordPixela#2609
they were 99 and now the lowest they"ve gone in half a year is 135Well I decided on 598 sr"s or 599"s a while back but I want to wait until they"re about 100 poundshd598sr *unless you"ve got another idealike akg"s or beyerdynamics
