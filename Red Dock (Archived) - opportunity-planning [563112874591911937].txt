[09-Apr-19 11:15 AM] Ninobf#2565
we should fill new oppo park with custom trees

[09-Apr-19 11:26 AM] LordPixela#2609
New oppo Park being the renovated one?
what kind of trees should we do
just oak or what

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Pansear70#2680
Acacia
Fits the theme

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Ninobf#2565
no acacia

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Pansear70#2680
Ree

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Ninobf#2565
some custom shit

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Pansear70#2680
Dark oak?

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] LordPixela#2609
it shouldn't be only acacia

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Pansear70#2680
Oh custom good idea

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Ninobf#2565
maybe cherry blossom?
eembrace the weebiness

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] LordPixela#2609
oooh

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Pansear70#2680
Yes cherry blossom

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] LordPixela#2609
how will we get pink leaves

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Pansear70#2680
Pink wool

[09-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Ninobf#2565
i made a cherry blossom tree befor
pink wool magenta clay

[09-Apr-19 11:28 AM] LordPixela#2609
let's make one massive tree
like a bruh cherry tree

[09-Apr-19 11:29 AM] Pansear70#2680
Make a massive tree for 6th tower
Lots of branches

[09-Apr-19 11:29 AM] LordPixela#2609
I still haven't visited the tower where everyone lives lol

[09-Apr-19 11:29 AM] Pansear70#2680
Chad tower?
It's, pretty epic

[09-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Ninobf#2565
yes

[09-Apr-19 11:30 AM] LordPixela#2609
Well I haven't seen people's houses
Chad tower is ex carrot one right

[09-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Ninobf#2565
yes

[09-Apr-19 11:30 AM] LordPixela#2609
yeah

[09-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Pansear70#2680
It was never really carrot one

[09-Apr-19 11:30 AM] LordPixela#2609
I've seen the second from roof floor
so they're all just like that?
rooms to put items?
for temporary living

[09-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Ninobf#2565
2 tps omegalul

[09-Apr-19 11:31 AM] LordPixela#2609

[09-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Pansear70#2680
I've yet to claim a floor, tho

[09-Apr-19 11:31 AM] LordPixela#2609
smae
I don't think I should claim a floor though

[09-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Pansear70#2680
I've got to get one for my flying machine

[09-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Ninobf#2565
we have plenty of empty ones

[09-Apr-19 11:31 AM] LordPixela#2609
I think it should literally just be like temporary living

[09-Apr-19 11:32 AM] Ninobf#2565

[09-Apr-19 11:32 AM] LordPixela#2609

I WAS GONNA SAY CHERRY BLOSSOM REEEE
Oppo park should be japan themed
small japanese cottages surrounded by cherry blossoms

[09-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Snekky#6713

[09-Apr-19 12:06 PM] LordPixela#2609

[09-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Snekky#6713
oh wait japan is our friend now
yes

[09-Apr-19 12:06 PM] LordPixela#2609
we far overpower the weak fake japan

[09-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Snekky#6713
ok

[09-Apr-19 12:13 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
yes we can have 'japan park'
for our allies

[09-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Ninobf#2565
we dont know if thats gonna last
just keep this name

[09-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Ninobf#2565
we need an xp farm

[09-Apr-19 02:05 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I will make one if anyone can find an ocean monument

[09-Apr-19 02:06 PM] Ninobf#2565
i was thinking of a smelter based farm

[09-Apr-19 02:06 PM] James B#2811
i was planning to make a guardian farm

[09-Apr-19 02:06 PM] Ninobf#2565
but a guardian farm would be amazing

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] James B#2811
problem is finding a monument

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Ninobf#2565
yeah

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] James B#2811
i know SL has one

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Ninobf#2565
annex time

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] James B#2811
pencylz owns it

[09-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Ninobf#2565
do we know of any witch huts

[09-Apr-19 02:08 PM] LordPixela#2609
aren't witches inefficient

[09-Apr-19 02:08 PM] James B#2811
ah witch farms thats gonna be a pain with the mob cap and they are a pain anyways also you would need to afk it

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] LordPixela#2609
they can drop ghasf tears tho right

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Ninobf#2565
no

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] James B#2811
people only rlly make em for red stone

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Ninobf#2565
they drop glowstone right

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] James B#2811
yup

[09-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Ninobf#2565
and sticks for infinite fuel

[09-Apr-19 02:10 PM] James B#2811
yeah but as i said mob cap alot of effort and you would be kicked for afk

[09-Apr-19 02:10 PM] Ninobf#2565
yeah :(
any other ideas?

[09-Apr-19 02:11 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I might be able to fix up a smelter design based on kelp

[09-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Ninobf#2565
nice
cactus farm would also be nice

[09-Apr-19 02:11 PM] James B#2811
guardian is reletively easy just lot of time and mob cap shouldnt effect it too much

[09-Apr-19 02:12 PM] Ninobf#2565
but finding one

[09-Apr-19 02:12 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
yee

[09-Apr-19 02:12 PM] James B#2811
there is a kelp farm in red dock but its unused

[09-Apr-19 02:12 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I can try to buy coords

[09-Apr-19 02:12 PM] James B#2811
or get an ocean monument map
if they work

[09-Apr-19 02:13 PM] Ninobf#2565
a furnace xp farm would be ideal
we can build it in oppo

[09-Apr-19 02:14 PM] James B#2811
yeah but they aint the fastest

[09-Apr-19 02:14 PM] Ninobf#2565
true
they'll be loaded a lot tho

[09-Apr-19 02:15 PM] LordPixela#2609
Idk about that one
we'd end up using a lot of coal
or we'd need tons of trees

[09-Apr-19 02:15 PM] James B#2811
kelp

[09-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Ninobf#2565
^
how big is the red dock kelp farm?

[09-Apr-19 02:17 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Yea am ocean monument might work
cuz it doesnt matter if its raider or not does it

[09-Apr-19 02:17 PM] James B#2811
its decent size i might need to do some maintenence tho

[09-Apr-19 02:18 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
the map

[09-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Ninobf#2565
how many plants?

[09-Apr-19 02:18 PM] James B#2811
i dunno if monument maps work tho being pregen and all

[09-Apr-19 02:18 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
it might not work cuz of custom gen
yee

[09-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Ninobf#2565
pretty sure they are broken yeah

[09-Apr-19 02:19 PM] James B#2811
ive put in a request to mapping corps for monument locations

[09-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Ninobf#2565
nice

[09-Apr-19 02:21 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
ty

[09-Apr-19 02:22 PM] James B#2811
apparently most of em have been claimed ill work on it

[09-Apr-19 03:22 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I will buy one
We should make the appelago on the west coast of oppo into japan
like shape it like japan

[09-Apr-19 03:23 PM] LordPixela#2609
like irl japan?

[09-Apr-19 03:23 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
yea
terraform it
We would need a shit tonne of sand but thats not that hard

[09-Apr-19 03:24 PM] James B#2811
i love terraforming for some reason

[09-Apr-19 03:26 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
we could build scaffolding in the shape of japan and the drop the sand into the ocean

[09-Apr-19 03:26 PM] Wuzado#3715
Maybe

[09-Apr-19 03:28 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
it already kinda looks like japan
I think it would be dope
we could make mount fuji

[09-Apr-19 04:24 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Ws could still make big cherry blossoms without them appearing on the map aswell, we would just put grasa blocks at the build limit over the pink blocks

[09-Apr-19 04:26 PM] Ninobf#2565
why would we wantt to hide them?

[09-Apr-19 06:00 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
becausw it would look ugly having pink dots on the map
because it wont be to scale

[09-Apr-19 06:01 PM] Ninobf#2565
having ffloating grass is even worse

[09-Apr-19 06:15 PM] James B#2811
or just have the grass for when during mapping

[09-Apr-19 06:30 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
how? 
@Ninobf
it would be at build height so you wouldnt really see it

[09-Apr-19 06:42 PM] Ninobf#2565
everything in opppo is build height
you're supposed to look up

[09-Apr-19 06:43 PM] James B#2811
^

[09-Apr-19 07:12 PM] Snekky#6713
nice

[09-Apr-19 07:53 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
not japan tho
it wont be on the main island of oppo

[09-Apr-19 07:57 PM] Snekky#6713
o yea maybe make the big island japan themed
sakura and shit

[09-Apr-19 09:23 PM] harry#7653

[09-Apr-19 09:26 PM] Snekky#6713

char no
reeee
the chunks under the pixel art are not loaded as often as the chunks we have set aside
we are building there
where the pixel art is will be the whole mesa area
mesa is for building not hentai smh
I'm working on making a seperate, distinct part of opportunity called the mesa district
it is still oppo but it kind ahas its own things
it would mostly be housing
less builds and farms
it would be to accomodate for the impending influx of players

ground level is y88 at building site
considering how slim it is, its not gonna be rresource-intense
can we maybe move it to a lower place?
it will look better i think
here maybe?
make this part look a bit less empty

[27-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Ninobf#2565
we have plenty of space for housing in the other towers yeah

[27-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Pansear70#2680
Maybe just for funsies?
some towers can be for show

[27-Apr-19 08:48 PM] Ninobf#2565

oppo ground level to sky level
or it should be 18 shorter, depending on location
i think it might be a bit too thick
@Deleted User
 thoughts?
building the outline would take 144 stacks of blocks
or 2.67 doublechests
if we stick with this design

how hard can it be:)

[27-Apr-19 09:23 PM] Ninobf#2565
pretty fucking hard considering how much netherbrick you would need

[27-Apr-19 09:23 PM] James B#2811
hush

[27-Apr-19 09:24 PM] Ninobf#2565
its a shame that we cant recreate the cloud thing the citadel has
not knowing how high it is because it disappears in the clouds

[27-Apr-19 09:27 PM] James B#2811
looootta cobwebs
surround it in a shit ton of cobwebs so you cant see the top and cant get to it

[27-Apr-19 09:30 PM] FoxRaid#3227
you could stack multiple layers of black - white stained glass
giving a fog effect
but
you'd have to do that around the tower using a lot of sand
also it might look unnatural in the sky with only one building there

[27-Apr-19 09:32 PM] Ninobf#2565
yeah thats gonna look really inconsistent

[27-Apr-19 09:32 PM] James B#2811
u look inconsistent

considering its 8430 feet tall proportions are gonna be interesting

[27-Apr-19 09:52 PM] Ninobf#2565
its gonna be scaled down for minecraft build limit
also considering its top is never seen im gonna stop just above the clouds
according to the model i sent its 10x as high as it is wide

[27-Apr-19 09:53 PM] James B#2811
ree make artificial clouds
easy 10 base 100 height

[27-Apr-19 09:53 PM] Ninobf#2565
mine is 25 wide and 185 high
should be 18/19 wide
also 
@Deleted User
 are you ok with moving it so it can be 20 blocks taller?

[27-Apr-19 09:56 PM] James B#2811
soo building material light gray concrete fits the best but its rather expensive

[27-Apr-19 09:56 PM] Ninobf#2565
19 is way too small
just realised

[27-Apr-19 09:56 PM] James B#2811
uh is it?

[27-Apr-19 09:57 PM] Ninobf#2565
sending
internet is so fucking slow wtf

[27-Apr-19 09:57 PM] James B#2811
we can technically build like two thirds of it and make the illusion that it is taller with some glass fog techniques
uh still sending?

we can do the base tower with stone and the extra parts and the exposed inner part with something else, like concrete

we can just build it up to the bit just above the side gap thing and make cobweb clouds which arnt actually that hard to get
wait ignore that
cobwebs are hard

[27-Apr-19 10:03 PM] Ninobf#2565
how do you even get them

[27-Apr-19 10:07 PM] Ninobf#2565

it looks best with wool but that causes shadows

[28-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Ninobf#2565
its still wip
stone and gray concrete
also glass but i already have a doublechest
any other blocks that would look good with this?
i was thinking polished andesite

[28-Apr-19 01:43 PM] James B#2811
cyan terracotta

[28-Apr-19 01:44 PM] Ninobf#2565
how the fuck do they call that cyan lmao

[28-Apr-19 01:44 PM] James B#2811
yeah but it looks gud

[28-Apr-19 01:44 PM] Ninobf#2565
true

[28-Apr-19 01:59 PM] LordPixela#2609
I heard a thing saying that they called it cyan cause its like cyan + the orangey-red of terracotta
so it's the colour you would get
if you mixed the two colours
and cyan terracotta is bae

[28-Apr-19 02:00 PM] James B#2811
facts and logic

[28-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Ninobf#2565

that makes slightly more sense
still

[28-Apr-19 02:06 PM] LordPixela#2609
nino do you think we can start building that tower today?
concrete is what gravel and sand?
I'll get some of that for you

[28-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Ninobf#2565

gravel and sand yes

[28-Apr-19 02:12 PM] James B#2811
I might grab some stuffs today got nothing else to do

[28-Apr-19 02:13 PM] LordPixela#2609
and about the ban
idk
my mum made me study a whole bunch today and since my brother had a turn I have one as well
but I'm pretty sure I'm on thin ice
like
ice on a lake when it's 18th of April thin

thanks
its going in oppo yeah

sec
one of these two probably
top because that district needs a tower

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO
Is make it follow the dragon shrine theme

[29-Apr-19 06:32 PM] FoxRaid#3227
ok since libtards didn't get my artistic drawing the yellow circle is where it will be since its base is in shallow water. From there maybe a bridge could go under the tower and connecting oppo with this small island on the  right side
yay or nay

But seriously, I plan on starting production soon, so whenever you want me to start just let me know :)
also, I've designed fully auto farming systems for the farming district if you'd want me to implement them when that gets built up
A piston, a redstone torch, and a piece of redstone dust
That's it
It doesn't technically use a glitch, but it uses burnt out torches as a sort of block update

[30-Apr-19 03:58 PM] Ninobf#2565

[30-Apr-19 03:58 PM] Zepp#3391
Nino

[30-Apr-19 03:58 PM] Onyx#4801
At least here, I drop about 10 frames (with my shaders only getting 60 on normal). Additionally, if we build it up more than across, it gets less laggy.
Then the whole row doesn't update, just the small vertical row.
And it only drops frames whenever a melon spawns, for about 5 ticks
Whats the color of chad tower?

[01-May-19 01:08 PM] Jay_#1816
@SupaPenguin
  for real i dont even know where im allowed to build yet

[01-May-19 01:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
you're gonna have to wait until we have a finalized place for you to build
until then send your current plans for the tower
do you have a build of it in a creative world?

[01-May-19 01:10 PM] Jay_#1816
no but i might just not do it now tbh and just build a normal house

[01-May-19 01:11 PM] Deleted User#0000

[01-May-19 06:50 PM] Onyx#4801
I'll remove the visible ones
I plan on like, making this shit PRETTY
Not just a barebones tower
Like a leaf bushes leading up the driveway
I plan on working on this like, all the time
@Ninobf
  I ran out of dirt again lmfao
@Deleted User
  do you have any dirt?

[01-May-19 07:17 PM] Onyx#4801
I'm going to start on the outline of the tower right now.

[01-May-19 07:18 PM] Ninobf#2565
still need dirt?

[01-May-19 07:22 PM] Onyx#4801
Yeah
Just to finish the area
What type of blocks do you want me to make it out of?
I'm using Prismarine slabs as an accent
Would you recommend I use stone brick as the base, or is that too basic?
@Ninobf

[01-May-19 07:27 PM] LordPixela#2609
do you have a reference for your project?
or is it kinda freehand

[01-May-19 07:28 PM] Ninobf#2565
show the pic again
onyx you can do whatever you think looks good
try to stick to the original
it looks good

[01-May-19 07:29 PM] Onyx#4801
*and not that resource intensive
The original uses terracotta and quart
quartz

[01-May-19 07:30 PM] Ninobf#2565
white concrete works

[01-May-19 07:30 PM] Onyx#4801
I don't think that's possible lmao
How do I get white concrete?

[01-May-19 07:30 PM] Ninobf#2565
4 sand 4 gravel 1 bonemeal=8 white concrete powder

[01-May-19 07:30 PM] Onyx#4801
huh
sounds pretty easy
ngl

[01-May-19 07:30 PM] Ninobf#2565
pour water over it to make concrete
yeah its cheap as fuck

[01-May-19 07:33 PM] Onyx#4801
Well, if ANYBODY has sand or gravel I'll buy it by the double chestful

[01-May-19 07:34 PM] LordPixela#2609
i have a double chest full of bones if you need it

[01-May-19 07:35 PM] Onyx#4801
omg yeet mate
If you want
to donate it
to opportunity

[01-May-19 07:36 PM] LordPixela#2609
i can put it in a chest near your building site next time I'm on

[01-May-19 07:36 PM] Onyx#4801
hell ye

[01-May-19 07:36 PM] LordPixela#2609
guessing you won't need more than 10 stacks of vones
30 stack of bonemeal whichis 30 stacks of white concrete
hm

[01-May-19 07:37 PM] Onyx#4801
I need a shit ton more concrete than 30 stacks, surprisingly

[01-May-19 07:37 PM] LordPixela#2609
wowie

[01-May-19 07:37 PM] Onyx#4801
yeah
its...kinda big
I have 1500 diamonds budget for this project though.
I'll be fine

[01-May-19 07:37 PM] LordPixela#2609
60 stacks?
of bonemeal

[01-May-19 07:38 PM] Onyx#4801
You're right. Let's start with 30 stacks

[01-May-19 07:38 PM] LordPixela#2609
alright

[01-May-19 07:38 PM] Onyx#4801

[01-May-19 07:39 PM] LordPixela#2609

[01-May-19 07:39 PM] Onyx#4801
(at what timezone?)

[01-May-19 07:39 PM] LordPixela#2609
Well my timezone is bst
or gmt in winter
basically uk

[01-May-19 07:40 PM] Onyx#4801
So it's next to the chad tower (opposite of orange tower), it's the stone brick with blue glass accents. I'm right next to it. I am the MASSIVE plot of dirt.

[01-May-19 07:40 PM] LordPixela#2609
lmao
righty
think you can place a sign as well?

[01-May-19 07:41 PM] Onyx#4801
I'm out of signs and wood. I do have fences placed on the right hand side of the plot
And some wooden planks are there instead of dirt, if you go out a little bit
It's fucking huge
All placed by hand lol
It's 18476 square blocks

[01-May-19 07:44 PM] Ninobf#2565
1 bonemeal is 8 concrete

[01-May-19 07:47 PM] LordPixela#2609
ah ok
I'll just give 10 stacks of bones then
should be way more than enough

[01-May-19 07:54 PM] Ninobf#2565
yeah

[01-May-19 09:29 PM] Onyx#4801
@Ninobf
  What type of blocks would you recommend for it? It's actually like, 40 stacks for just the first level
I'm probably going to do stone brick, as concrete is expensive as fuuuuuuck
I might use it for the floor though

[01-May-19 09:35 PM] Ninobf#2565
alright
concrete isnt expensive at all tho

[01-May-19 09:37 PM] Juulia#5980
You could use terracotta  
@Onyx

[01-May-19 09:42 PM] Onyx#4801
terracotta sooo fucking expensive
I mean
If you think I can get 100+stacks, I'd love it :D

no these shouldnt e build height
we need secondary towers
if everything is world height it creates a weird disparity between giga towers and small houses

[02-May-19 01:40 PM] FoxRaid#3227
i diagnose you with giga downs x2
your help is useless

[02-May-19 01:40 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
just warning you

[02-May-19 01:40 PM] FoxRaid#3227
move your farm
it doesnt fit either

[02-May-19 01:40 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I've been considering it
but chunks need to be loaded 
And I'm going to make it fit

[02-May-19 01:40 PM] FoxRaid#3227
if you move your farm ill consider moving the house

[02-May-19 01:40 PM] Ninobf#2565
underground maybe?
the farm

[02-May-19 01:41 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
maybe

[02-May-19 01:41 PM] Ninobf#2565
we can do it under chad tower
so it barely moves
i'll help

[02-May-19 01:41 PM] LordPixela#2609
was I pinged here?
can't rmember

[02-May-19 01:41 PM] SupaPenguin#0888

can we hire the one guy to mine chunks

[02-May-19 01:41 PM] Ninobf#2565
@Sharp!Disc

[02-May-19 01:41 PM] FoxRaid#3227
anyways move your farm then ill move the house

[02-May-19 01:42 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
Aight b
What if I make the farm fit

[02-May-19 01:42 PM] FoxRaid#3227
since it doesnt fit and you decided to attack me first
then ill make the house fit

[02-May-19 01:42 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
How

[02-May-19 01:42 PM] FoxRaid#3227
if you can make your house fit i can make mine

[02-May-19 01:42 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
it needs to be 
tall

[02-May-19 01:42 PM] FoxRaid#3227
ill knock it down and remake it

[02-May-19 01:42 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
If you want to build a tower
I'm fine with that

[02-May-19 01:43 PM] FoxRaid#3227
if you'll remake the other building that doesnt fit then ill do it

[02-May-19 01:44 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
bruh its my district you finna listen to me

[02-May-19 01:44 PM] FoxRaid#3227

[02-May-19 01:44 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
he's gettin moved too
i've already talked to him
And his is pretty out of the way currently

[02-May-19 01:45 PM] Ninobf#2565
i'd love to revive oppo park sometime
any chance that we can find a spot in prox?

[02-May-19 01:45 PM] SupaPenguin#0888

[02-May-19 01:45 PM] FoxRaid#3227

[02-May-19 01:46 PM] FoxRaid#3227
after youre done im remaking it

[02-May-19 01:46 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
I offered to help move it

[02-May-19 01:46 PM] FoxRaid#3227
since land is claimed under tgn rules

[02-May-19 01:46 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
you will remake it 
elsewhere
That's not how eviction works
once you're evicted I own that joint
I'm not trying to be petty

[02-May-19 01:47 PM] Ninobf#2565
since fox is not being evicted from oppo he doesnt need to (re)move his house

[02-May-19 01:47 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
It just doesnt fit
hes being evicted from proximal

[02-May-19 01:47 PM] FoxRaid#3227
yes you are this  is the smallest of problems

[02-May-19 01:47 PM] SupaPenguin#0888
not oppo as a whole
I'm trying to plan ahead 

[02-May-19 01:47 PM] Ninobf#2565
char is there no way you can work around it?

[02-May-19 01:48 PM] FoxRaid#3227
ive told you i can remake it multiple times but you insist on removing me
for some reason you dont want me there

[02-May-19 01:48 PM] SupaPenguin#0888

Also here's the right side of my desk i didnt show
Anyway, my bf's on the right in that picture is the Sennheiser HD58x, AKG K7XX, Shure se215s, and Sennheiser PC363D
Also this USB stick (Digital Analog Converter to be technical) made me save up for 2 months to get it. It's actually expensive as fuck. Dragonfly Red if you're interested.
Totally worth it, but still.

[04-May-19 07:11 AM] LordPixela#2609
what does it do?

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] Onyx#4801
So, every time you have a 'headphone jack', right, it's a DAC (digital analog converter)
The one in your phone, has a dac

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] LordPixela#2609
ah right

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] Onyx#4801
the dongle from lighting to aux, dac

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] LordPixela#2609
yeah I didn't know what dac stood for
yee I kinda know how it works

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] Onyx#4801
The audio on your motherboard, ye

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] LordPixela#2609
how come just a dac and not an amp as well?

[04-May-19 07:12 AM] Onyx#4801
So this DAC basically has a better chip than the rest. oh i'll send pics of my amp just gimme a minute

[04-May-19 07:13 AM] LordPixela#2609
aight

[04-May-19 07:13 AM] Onyx#4801
Anyway better chip = less noise

[04-May-19 07:13 AM] LordPixela#2609
mhm
although it's only noticeable if you have good headphones

[04-May-19 07:13 AM] Onyx#4801
or speakers for what I usually use
the image is still loading

[04-May-19 07:13 AM] LordPixela#2609

idk either. Just to be clear tho, speakers aren't necessarily better than headphones. I only have 2 sets of speakers, and if you scroll up I have.....too many headphones. I just used to prefer the sound of headphones to speakers, until I got this pair of Elacs I have today

[04-May-19 07:15 AM] Ninobf#2565
headphones>speakers bc i live with others

[04-May-19 07:15 AM] LordPixela#2609
I mean for music speakers are generally better
cause you have real surround sound

[04-May-19 07:16 AM] Onyx#4801
eh, pixela if you've tried an open back headphone its pretty different

[04-May-19 07:16 AM] LordPixela#2609
I want to buy a pair of sennheiser 598 sr's but they got more expensive
on amazon

[04-May-19 07:16 AM] Onyx#4801
What's your budget? I'm a headphone god when it comes to knowledge

[04-May-19 07:16 AM] LordPixela#2609
they were 99 and now the lowest they've gone in half a year is 135
Well I decided on 598 sr's or 599's a while back but I want to wait until they're about 100 pounds
hd598sr *
unless you've got another idea
like akg's or beyerdynamics

[04-May-19 01:14 PM] LordPixela#2609
uh ok so my build is gonna take tonnes of dark oak wood

[04-May-19 01:15 PM] haha yes#0921
Logs or planks

[04-May-19 01:15 PM] LordPixela#2609
logs

[04-May-19 01:16 PM] haha yes#0921
ouch
they're not too hard with the felling plugin tho
Just find a dark oak forest, get a unbreaking 3 dia axe, and go monky

[04-May-19 01:22 PM] LordPixela#2609
know any dark oak forests?

[04-May-19 01:27 PM] haha yes#0921
Yeah but can't grab coords rn

[04-May-19 02:50 PM] LordPixela#2609
mfw im like 7 blocks/190
and im using the wood instead of logs
so its 4 to 3
luckily its hollow

[05-May-19 05:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
also the museum is going in the mesa district
it’s not gonna be small
its not gonna be overwhelming big either tho

[05-May-19 05:17 PM] Hass#6829
no idea where it’s gonna be
we could use a skyscraper?

[05-May-19 05:17 PM] Ninobf#2565

[05-May-19 05:17 PM] Deleted User#0000

[05-May-19 05:18 PM] Ninobf#2565

[05-May-19 05:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
i might scrap zoo unless i can get a lot of help
might pay someone to build it too

[05-May-19 05:21 PM] Hass#6829
I have to pay someone to build my house
I’ll ask some new players

[05-May-19 05:22 PM] Juulia#5980

[05-May-19 05:23 PM] Hass#6829

[05-May-19 05:23 PM] Juulia#5980
you want his discord?

[05-May-19 05:23 PM] Hass#6829
But for the museum, what if we kept some of the less valuable items and auctioned them once in a while
I have his discord

[05-May-19 05:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
not a bad idea but the reset is close so they wont be worth much

[05-May-19 05:24 PM] Hass#6829
that’s true

[05-May-19 05:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
i want  a collection of rare items so people with the world download can see them

[05-May-19 05:24 PM] Hass#6829

[05-May-19 05:24 PM] Deleted User#0000

[05-May-19 05:24 PM] Hass#6829

[05-May-19 05:25 PM] Deleted User#0000

[05-May-19 05:25 PM] Hass#6829

[05-May-19 05:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
